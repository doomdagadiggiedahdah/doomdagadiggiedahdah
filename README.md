### About Me

AI researcher with published work in LLM Agent Benchmarks and Mechanistic Interpretability. My NeurIPS 2024 paper "GameBench" was accepted to the Language Gamification Workshop. I focus on the intersection of type theory, SWE, abstract algebra, and formal methods.

### Research Publications

- **[Meta Models: Understanding Representational Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02472)** - Mechanistic interpretability research

### Current Projects

- **Large Scale Audio Analysis with Whisper** - Scalable emergency indicator processing with configurable parallel GPU scaling
- **Voice Note to Obsidian Integration** - Automated transcription pipeline with keyword recognition
- **Cortext.io Semantic Primitive LLM** - Revived and documented lightweight LLM based on semantic primitives
