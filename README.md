### About Me
AI researcher with published work in LLM Agent Benchmarks and Mechanistic Interpretability. My NeurIPS 2024 paper "GameBench" was accepted to the Language Gamification Workshop. I focus on the intersection of type theory, SWE, abstract algebra, and formal methods.

### Research Publications
- **[GameBench: Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Abilities of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06613)** - [NeurIPS award](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/106557)
- **[Meta-Models: An Architecture for Decoding LLM Behaviors Through Interpreted Embeddings and Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02472)**

### Recent Projects
- **[Large Scale Audio Analysis with Whisper](https://github.com/doomdagadiggiedahdah/copterSpotWhisper)** - Scalable emergency indicator processing with configurable parallel GPU scaling
- **[Voice Note to Obsidian Integration](https://github.com/doomdagadiggiedahdah/fleetingNotes)** - Automated transcription pipeline with keyword-recognition based sorting
- **Cortext.io Semantic Primitive LLM** - Research collaboration on a Natural Language parser for semantic primitives
- Co-organizer of an [AI paper reading group](https://noisebridgeai.xyz/)
